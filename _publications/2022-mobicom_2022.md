Timely detection of roadside assets that require maintenance is essential for improving citizen satisfaction. Currently, the process of identifying such maintenance issues is typically performed manually, which is time consuming, expensive, and slow to respond. In this paper, we present Mobile IoT- RoadBot, a mobile 5G-based Internet of Things (IoT) solution, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to enable opportunistic real-time identification and detection of main- tenance issues with roadside assets.
