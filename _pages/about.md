Welcome to Yong-Bin Kang's homepage! I am a [senior data science research fellow](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=ykang) for the Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision Making and Society ([ADM+S](https://www.admscentre.org.au/)) at Swinburne University, Australia. 
Since June 2018, I have been now employed as a senior research fellow at Swinburne, helping lead/co-lead industry and government funded research projects in the areas of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and data mining (DM).

I am an intellectually curious and analytical data scientist with the ability to systematically conceptualise problems and discover hidden insights from real-life problems by using quantitative and qualitative data analysis techniques. My research expertise and interests are mainly in the fields of NLP, ML, and DM. I have experience in working, managing and delivering large industrial, multi-disciplinary research projects in data science such as patent analytics, clinical data analytics, scientific-article analytics, social-media data analytics, expert finding and matching, and machine learning algorithms and applications.

I have recently developed an NLP based technological trajectory for patent examination process in IP Australia during 2018 - 2020. As a computer scientist, I completed my PhD (Monash University, 2011) and was a core member of Swinburneâ€™s Data Science Research Institute at Swinburne during 2018 - 2020. My research outcomes have been demonstrated by publications in Information Systems journal, WIREs data mining and knowledge discovery, JMIR public health and surveillance, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics. Some representative conference papers A/A* include AAAI, ECAI, ISWC, CIKM, K-CAP, and ACL.

I have also experience teaching bachelors and master courses in the capacity of a lecturer and tutor in Faculty of IT at Monash University during 2014 - 2018. My teachings were focused on the areas of data science such as natural language processing, machine learning, and data mining and big data processing.
